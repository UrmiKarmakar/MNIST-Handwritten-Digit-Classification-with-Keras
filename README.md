# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-with-Keras
This project demonstrates a neural network-based approach to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Built with Keras and TensorFlow, it includes steps for data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation. The model predicts digit classes from 0-9, and the results are visualized using Matplotlib.
